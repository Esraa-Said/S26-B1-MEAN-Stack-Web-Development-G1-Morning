## 2- Check Server Status with Retry
📋 Task Description:
Simulate pinging a server. If it's offline, retry up to 5 times. Stop and log an error after the fifth failure.

🧩 Methods Used:
Math.random() for unpredictability
for loop with await
Promises inside pingServer()

🔍 Helpful Notes:
Uses try/catch inside the loop so failed attempts don’t crash the program.
Can be extended to implement exponential backoff.
